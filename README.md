LessonsLearnedIn.NET Projects contain code patterns and examples written in C#.

### Synopsis

This repository contains:
 + Custom configuration using System.Configuration base classes and attributes
 + Common configuration file hosted in a class library that is linked to another library
 + Slow cheetah transform

Motivation

There have been many times where open source code examples or Stack Overflow submission have helped me during a struggle. These projects are my attempt to give back to the open source community. Feel free to participate.
